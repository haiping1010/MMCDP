In this study, we developed a MicroMutate model and two graph-based antibody-antigen interaction prediction models. These models were integrated with evolutionary constraints, statistical potentials, molecular dynamics simulations, and metadynamics methods to construct an antibody point mutation design pipeline, named the Multi-Method Collaborative Design Pipeline (MMCDP)ã€‚

The antibody_design_deep_fragment2_larger_n folder contains examples for evolutionary constraints, statistical potentials screening.

The usage_all_redo_no_norm contain examples of MicroMutate model and its usage.

The complex_train_redo_usage is the usage example of DeepGCN_Anti.

The complex_train_redo_structure_based_reduce_usage is the usage example of Sgraph_AB.


Conda Environment
For the DeepGCN_Anti and Sgraph_AB have same environmental file (xxxx)

For the usage_all_redo_no_norm folder, environmental file is xxx

For evolutionary constraints, statistical potentials screening, python 3.8 and blast is needed.
